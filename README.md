# infinity_scroll

[Demo](https://ryderhe.github.io/infinity_scroll/)

- make own loading animation with the loading.io website

- implement infinite scroll functionality (as the user scrolls near the bottom of the page, another network request is made but it happens before you reach the bottom)

- images are photos fetched from unsplash API

- track the moments all the images are loaded in order to dynamically hide the loading animation

- hovering over the image could see the description

- clicking on the image would jump to the website and then you could see the author or download the photo 

- mobile responsive
